# CS231n
These are my solutions to assignments from course cs231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

Coursework included implementing the following in python:
1. Image recognition using fully connected networks, svm, linear classifier.
2. Image classification using convolutional neural network
You can find a customizable implementation of a deep learning network in the file `cnn.py` under assignment 2. 
It uses just numpy and cython. The results can be found in the ipython notebook that accompanies the folder. 
I got 73% accuracy on CIFAR dataset.
3. Image captioning using LSTM

Apart from the above techniques like batch normalization, dropout, optimization methods like standard sgd, momentum, adam.. were also part of assignments
